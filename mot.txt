1. setup up local gpu environment

2. python package and convert yolo to tensorflow

3. mot problem statement, object detection and recognition
	-how to perform = yolo
	-object tracking = locating moving objects in videos. tracking and maintaining the assignment of ID

4.Simple online real time tracking ( Sort ). 
	-handle motion prediction and data association
	-relies on simple motion model
	-Sort with deep assoiciation metric = Deep Sort = extension of sort.

5. How yolo and deep sort work.
	-object detection and recognition = yolo or fast-cnn
	-motion prediction and feature generation 
	-tracking

6. What yolo and deep sort use for.
	-tracking
	-counting = gate
	-density map/heat map/heat zone = -zone = in out, count in specific
